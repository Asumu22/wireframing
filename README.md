# Wireframing: From Wireframe to Prototype

## Introduction
Wireframing is a crucial step in the **UI/UX design process**, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application.  
It outlines the basic structure and layout without focusing on detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.  

**Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process:**  
- **Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:** Translates abstract ideas into tangible representations for stakeholders.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Ensures team members, clients, and stakeholders are aligned on design and functionality.  
- **Identifies Usability Issues:** Highlights navigation problems, content hierarchy, and interaction flaws early.  
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Detects design flaws before development, reducing costly revisions.  
- **Guides the Design Process:** Provides a reference for the development and design teams to maintain consistency.  

This repository will document the essential concepts, key elements, types, tools, and benefits of wireframing, with a focus on practical application using **Figma**.
